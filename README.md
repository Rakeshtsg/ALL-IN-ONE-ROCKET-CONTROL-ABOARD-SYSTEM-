# ALL-IN-ONE-ROCKET-CONTROL-ABOARD-SYSTEM-

code for a complex rocket dual servo control onboard computer in Arduino:{CODE 1 dual servo control onboard computer in Arduino}
EXPLANATION: In this code, we are using an altitude sensor to control the angle of two servos that are attached to the rocket. The altitude sensor is connected to the Arduino on pin A0, and the servos are connected to pins 9 and 10.

In the setup() function, we attach the servos to the control pins and set the altitude sensor pin as an input. In the loop() function, we read the altitude sensor value, map it to servo angles, and set the servos to those angles. We then wait 10 milliseconds before checking the altitude again.

Note that we are using the altitude sensor value to control the angle of the first servo in one direction (0-180) and the angle of the second servo in the opposite direction (180-0). This allows us to control two servos with a single sensor.

As before, this is just a very basic example, and you will need to adapt it to your specific requirements and needs. You may want to include additional sensors and use that data to control the servos, or add safety checks and fail-safes to ensure the safe operation of your rocket.
